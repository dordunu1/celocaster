# Getting Started

Getting started with CeloCaster is designed to be straightforward, especially for users already active within the Farcaster ecosystem. Follow these simple steps to begin creating or participating in decentralized prediction markets on Celo:

1.  **Access the CeloCaster Mini-app:** Navigate to the CeloCaster mini-app directly within your Farcaster application. The mini-app provides the primary interface for interacting with the platform without leaving your Farcaster feed.

2.  **Connect a Compatible Wallet:** Ensure you have a Web3 wallet that is compatible with the Celo network. Connect your wallet to the CeloCaster mini-app when prompted. Your wallet will be used to sign transactions and manage your CELO.

3.  **Fund Your Wallet with CELO:** To participate in prediction markets, you will need to have CELO in your connected wallet to cover the platform stake for creating bets and the vote stake for participating in them.

4.  **Browse Active Markets:** Explore the list of active prediction markets available on the CeloCaster feed. You can filter markets by category (e.g., Crypto, General), status (Active, Resolved), or type (Community Vote, Price Verified).

5.  **Create a New Bet (Optional):** If you have a prediction in mind, you can create your own market. Provide a clear prediction statement, select the category, set the vote stake amount and duration, and specify asset details if it's a price-verified bet. You will need to confirm the transaction and pay the platform stake with your connected wallet.

6.  **Vote on a Bet:** To participate in an existing market, select the bet you want to vote on. Choose either "Yay" or "Nay" based on your prediction and confirm the transaction to stake your vote amount from your wallet.

7.  **Track Bet Progress:** Monitor the progress of bets you've created or voted on within the mini-app. You can see the current vote counts, time remaining, and eventually the resolved outcome.

8.  **Claim Winnings:** If a bet you voted on resolves to the winning side, you will be eligible to claim your proportional share of the prize pool. Use the claim functionality within the app to receive your winnings in CELO in your connected wallet.

By following these steps, you can actively participate in the decentralized prediction market activity on CeloCaster and the Celo blockchain.
