# How it Works (Simplified)

CeloCaster simplifies the process of participating in decentralized prediction markets. Here's a basic flow of how a bet moves through the platform:

1.  **Creating a Bet:** A user initiates a new prediction market by proposing a specific outcome (e.g., "Will the price of CELO exceed $1 by the end of the week?"). If it's a verified market, they select the asset, the price threshold, and whether they predict a price increase (pump) or decrease (dump). The creator pays a small platform stake (currently 3 CELO) and sets the required vote stake amount (minimum 0.1 CELO) that other users must pay to vote.

2.  **Voting on a Bet:** Interested users can browse active bets and choose to participate by voting "Yay" or "Nay" on the predicted outcome. To cast a vote, they must send the required vote stake amount in CELO, which is then added to the bet's total prize pool. Users can only vote once per bet.

3.  **Bet Resolution:** Once the predetermined duration of the bet expires, the market is ready for resolution. The smart contract determines the winning side based on the bet type:
    *   **Verified Markets:** The contract queries the relevant Chainlink price feed to get the final price of the asset at expiry. The outcome (Yay or Nay wins) is automatically determined based on whether the price movement met or exceeded the creator's specified price threshold in the predicted direction.
    *   **Community Voted Markets:** The winning side is determined by the simple majority of the total vote stake amount staked on either Yay or Nay.

4.  **Prize Claiming:** After a bet has been resolved, users who voted on the winning side are eligible to claim their winnings. The smart contract calculates each winning voter's proportional share of the total prize pool based on their individual vote stake. Winning users can then call the `claimPrize()` function to receive their share of the CELO from the prize pool.

Essentially, CeloCaster automates the escrow of funds, the resolution of outcomes (either via oracle data or community consensus), and the distribution of prizes, all in a transparent and non-custodial manner on the Celo blockchain.
