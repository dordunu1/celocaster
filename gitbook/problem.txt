# Problem

Traditional prediction markets frequently encounter significant challenges related to centralization, which can lead to issues of trust and transparency. They often involve higher fees and may present limitations in terms of accessibility for a broad user base. Concurrently, within the rapidly evolving decentralized landscape, particularly within the Celo ecosystem, there is a clear and growing demand for more interactive, engaging, and fully on-chain decentralized applications (dApps) that are seamlessly integrated into existing social platforms like Farcaster. The current gap lies in the availability of prediction market platforms that are not only decentralized and transparent but also offer a fluid user experience directly within the social feeds where users are already active, thereby reducing friction and encouraging wider participation.
